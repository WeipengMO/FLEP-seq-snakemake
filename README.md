# FLEP-seq Preprocessing Pipeline

FLEP-seq (full-length elongating and polyadenylated RNA sequencing) allows calculation of the kinetics of cotranscriptional splicing and detects polyadenylated transcripts with unspliced introns retained at specific positions posttranscriptionally.

This pipeline includes basecalling and preprocessing of the FLEP-seq data.
